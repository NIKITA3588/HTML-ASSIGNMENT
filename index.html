        <h1>CYBERSECURITY:Impact in Future Generation</h1>
        <p>By 2050, smart cities and homes will be the standard. In the home, smart devices including voice assistance, vacuum cleaners, and toilets will be a soft target for cybercriminals. These gadgets or devices do not store sensitive data themselves, but they link to others that do and are weak access points to hackers again.
            In this hyper-connected world, the threat cyber criminals introduce will only multiply. The future strives with cybersecurity and it's time to look further ahead.  Thus, the readiness by every organization to get it in-board and enhance trending security standards.
            A career in cybersecurity is a lucrative, future transforming, and twice the career scope for the next generation. It is an in-demand career with abundant queries and twisting predictions. The cybersecurity job employment rate is estimated at 100% and the worldwide cybersecurity market will reach approx. 6 billion in 2023.
            Artificial intelligence and machine learning will be vital. It aids to identify threats and fraudsters by generating deep fakes. But, privacy becomes a major concern. Therefore, policymakers and designers must work hard to ensure that this does not become a binary choice
